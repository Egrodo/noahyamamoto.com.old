<p>This project started as a Leetcode algorithm challenge to solve Sudoku puzzles, but then I thought, heck, I’m a front-end developer aren’t I? Let’s use this as an excuse to learn Progressive Web Apps and write the best possible React Sudoku app there ever was.</p>

<p>There were a lot of (un)expected challenges with the development of the logic (figuring out how to generate puzzles took 5x as long as solving them), but I wanted to learn how to do everything on my own with no extraneous library use.</p>

<p>This game has just about every feature I could think of, including four difficulty levels with infinite potential games, cookie saving, responsive design, PWA, and an overly complicated error displaying system.</p>

<p>I’d recommend checking out the source of the <a href="https://github.com/Egrodo/sudoku/blob/master/src/sudoku.js">modularized Sudoku logic</a> to see how I did that stuff, and the <a href="https://github.com/Egrodo/sudoku/blob/master/src/components/GameContainer.js">game container component</a> to explore the React codebase.</p>
